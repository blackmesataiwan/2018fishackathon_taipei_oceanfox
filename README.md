# Formosan salmon submarine sampling system
We use autopilot submarines as vehicles to sample water at specific locations and depths using electronic sensing and sampling machinery.

We integrate different equipments (Thunder Tiger Submarine, QNAP QBoat Sunny IoT storage device, color detector sensor, temperature sensor, Arduino)  & Communication system (Sigfox) to build a solution to create freshwater monitoring and communication system.
# Device
Using QNAP QBoat Sunny and Arduino to build  a data storage .

### QNAP QBoat Sunny

Using QNAP QBoat Sunny serves as the control center to storage the data as an private cloud service.

### Arduino

We control sensors (e.g., color detector sensor, temperature sensor, antenna).
We transmit GPS coordinate and sensing data by Sigfox communication technology.
